        <h2>Responsive VS Mobile Development</h2>
        <p>There are estimated to be 3.8 billion smartphones worldwide by the end 2021, and 3.5 billion smartphones currently browsing apps and websites worldwide right now. Industry has already started pivoting toward a mobile first approach and making inroads into the app marketplaces. As a company it's important to think about which solution to work toward and understand the pros and cons of each of the different design philosophies. It is also important to work towards implementing both solutions as there are advantages to both but together!</p>
        <h3>Responsive web design:</h3>
        <p>Responsive mobile design generally means that your site is designed specifically for mobile use. It will often be housed under a different URL (usually something like m.yoursite.com) and will feature subsets of your desktop content that are appropriate for mobile viewing. These pages will adapt to whatever screen size the user desires. The overall goal of a responsive web design is to provide a seamless experience to the end user across a wide range of devices, screen sizes, and system architectures. Usually, these pages start with a bottom-up approach to design, starting with a mobile site and then building up and out, adding features, details and complexity. With addition of media-queries to CSS the tools available to UI/UX designers allow them to provide fine grain control of the look and feel of the various iterations of the website.</p>
        <p>
            <h5> Pros of Responsive design: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper to produce. Instead of needing to hire a developer to write an app from the ground up, you can use existing frameworks and resources of which there are a multitude.</li>
                <li>Time to market is low. Again instead of needing to write something from the ground up you can slap a website together very quickly while still allowing yourself the capability to improve and add features.</li>
                <li>Cross platform capability. There is no need to write an IOS app - An Android app, a Windows app.</li>
                <li>Content gets indexed by google or other web crawlers. Allowing yourself to get indexed allows people to link to your content, as well as organic discovery and social media tagging.</li>
                <li>No installations required. Rather than having to have an end user download a potentially large file, make an account, wait, more waiting. It's always on (assuming internet) and easy to use.</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Mobile web design:</h3>
            <p>
                Mobile apps, on the other hand, are specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases. In the Smartphone era, many companies are waking up to the need to engage users at a deeper level than merely a website.
            </p>
            <h5> Pros of Mobile Apps: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Better performance. Being able to use native system level code enables a developer to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the users device. </li>
                <li>Consistency. Rather than expecting users to learn a new UI with each new website, each platform offers both consistency of theme and  visuals - interactions.</li>
                <li>Working offline. If your app is downloaded to an end users phone it will function without a stable internet connection.</li>
                <li>More freedom. Access to gestures, device hardware, and locational functionality enabled developers much more freedom to develop more interesting and engaging applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5> Cons of Mobile Apps: </h5>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can’t run on a device with a different operating system. You will need to write a different app for both IOS and Android as well as any other OS’s you would like to support.</li>
            <li>It’s expensive to build. Most Mobile or Native apps need to be built from the ground up, which takes time, money and developers.</li>
            <li>It’s harder to acquire new users. The app stores to some degrees are full or at least hard to navigate and hard to make your App stand out from all of detritus and competition. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p> 
            Mobile apps and Responsive design both sort of solve the same problem so care must be taken to decide which problems the customer needs solved and which design philosophy falls within those needs. More and more companies are deciding to both have responsive design as well as a mobile app so in some cases it is a matter of which do you want to do first.
