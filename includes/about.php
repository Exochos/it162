            Hello! This is a little about myself, I am a Xillenial living in Seattle. I work and live in downtown Seattle.
            I like long walks in the wilderness, preferably with a cute doggo. I have been working on learning to code for a about a year now and am enjoying it quite a lot.
            I enjoy web development both front and back end. I am looking forward to learning all about PHP and web development!
