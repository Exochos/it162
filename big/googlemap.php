        "The Spheres are a place where employees can think and work differently surrounded by plants.
The Spheres are a result of innovative thinking about the character of a workplace and an extended conversation about what is typically missing from urban officesâ€“ a direct link to nature. The Spheres are home to more than 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of over 30 countries."
