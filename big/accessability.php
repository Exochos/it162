      <h5>Accessibility - the Web and the Developer, Fed 2, 2020</h5>
      
      <p>Web accessibility is incredibly important for any web developer. “One in four adults in the United States has a disability”  many of which require the use of non-standard browsers, business would be unwise to exclude these potential customers. In addition, the US government and education system has made it “illegal discrimination” to fail to provide online information accessibility within goverment websites.</p>
      <p>In 1990  the US congress passed the Citizens with Disability act mandating that all government websites be accessible to as wide a possible audience as possible. Then in 1999 the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  came out with the Web Accessibility standards which further raised and refined the standards of content delivery to anyone relying on alternate content or not using a standard browser. Other standards which brought further changes were also introduced, such as the UN accessibility standards and the Section 508 Standards.  The UN attempted to create unified standards across languages and country borders. In the US the Section 508 Standards “apply not only to web page content, but to posted content such as PDF documents, and audio and video content. Such requirements ensure that all web content, regardless of the medium, are accessible by all citizens”. (3).</p>
      <p>Several studies have shown that industry best practice in regards to accessibility also results in faster load times and better SEO ROI. Additionally, content is easier to access and gives businesses a wider industry reach. “It’s becoming clear that major search engines, such as Google, are promoting the SEO benefits of Web Accessibility techniques …  The overlap between SEO and WCAG in over 10 key areas is another motivation that becoming WCAG 2.0 compliant will buttress your SEO score in the eyes of the major search engines.”</p>
      <p>As a web developer it was new to me to think about creating a site which not only does all of the normal services but also ensuring that content is easily accessible to all possible audiences. Making sure my site creates a welcoming experience for all. </p>
      <p>During the course of my research I have found several very helpful tools and websites whcih I love!. The first amazing site I  found was : <a href="https://www.digitala11y.com/accessibility-cheat-sheets/" alt="accessability cheat sheet">https://www.digitala11y.com/accessibility-cheat-sheets/ </a>which is massive dump of various cheatsheets to help the developer create a totally usable website.
      Another site I found incredibly helpful was: <a href="https://codepen.io/weboverhauls/full/zYvopYE" alt="codepen">https://codepen.io/weboverhauls/full/zYvopYE</a> which has a handy checklist that a developer can work through.</p>
